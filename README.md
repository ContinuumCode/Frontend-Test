# Continuum - Frontend Coding Assessment


## Brief

1.	Try to fully complete the assessment but if you get stuck move on to the next part.
2.	Use Bootstrap Version 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) for the layouts. This will help with device responsiveness.
3.	All icons used should be from font awesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
4.	In terms of fonts feel free to use the font of your choice in the exercises.
5.	Only ES6 Javascript. No libraries or frameworks such as React, Angular or jQuery are allowed. We want to see your vanilla Javascript skill level.
6.	The completed code should match the concepts below as much as possible, we understand there may be differences between the font used in the concept and the font file and this is ok. The font used throughout the mockup is Montserrat and can be found on Google Fonts here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
7.	If you have any questions about the assessment please email us before you start.


### Code Test:

Recreate a single page with the following requirements:

1.	Header with Nav and Logo (The only functionality needed here is a dropdown menu under the portfolio menu item and hover effects). On mobile, the navigation should drop into a mobile menu and be clickable to show the menu using Javascript ES6 (No Javascript libraries or frameworks allowed). This should be located in the top right of the screen and slide in from the right.
2.	Banner - Please use only Javascript here (No Javascript libraries or frameworks allowed). You will be tested on how clean your code functions and reads. A minimum of 3 images are required. Any images can be used. This should also adapt to mobile, with the text and imagery fitting correctly and readable on the screen.
3.	News Blocks x 3 (Buttons do not need to be functional and don’t need to redirect). These should be replicated as seen in the screenshot. When scaling to mobile, they should stack.
4.	Logo/Portfolio –  This is a grid that should take advantage of the Bootstrap 4 framework. Since Bootstrap 4 uses flexbox, please do not use CSS Grid or any other system. Only use Bootstrap. On mobile this should stack and list in the following order: Huawei, Sony, Apple and Nokia.
5.	Accordion - The accordion should be built with html, css and Javascript only (No libraries or frameworks). All accordions should be closed on page load. When clicking on an accordion, it should smoothly slide down and back up when closed. When a second accordion is clicked, it should slide down and the previous open accordion should slide up and close. Add a transition effect to the accordion icon when activated to give it some personality. It should start as a down chevron and change to an x when open and reverse when closed.

### Requirements

1.	All HTML, CSS, & Javascript should be well commented and comments should be written in a non-technical manner.
2.	The code should be fully tested for all contexts (Mobile, Tablet & Desktops), see browser list below. Everything should be responsive.
3.	Validate all the code written using https://validator.w3.org/
4.	Make sure to focus on writing clean code and reusable code.
5.	When submitting the task please create a separate folder in the format of: FrontEnd_Code_Test_YOURNAME and include any files and assets needed.
6.	If you get stuck at any part don't worry and get through as much of it as you can. This test is to see how you perform with certain tasks and to find out what skill level you are at. If you can’t complete something, move on to the next part and come back to it later.


### Bonus

Use any of the following below:

1.	Use a build tool to create the end solutions (e.g. gulp/grunt)
2.	Write the CSS using SCSS (Please include your source folder with all .scss files)
4.	Use GIT to show your commits and your approach to the test. Please link to your repository, we would like to see your commits and how you work during a project.
